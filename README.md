# Just a quick proof of coocept for content blocks with astro

## Getting started

First run `npm ci` once.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
